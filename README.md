# Eye-Controlled Mouse and Hand-Controlled Mouse Projects

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains two touchless input projects using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **PyAutoGUI**:

1. **Eye-Controlled Mouse**: A hands-free mouse control system using eye movements.
2. **Hand-Controlled Mouse**: A touchless mouse control system using hand gestures.

Both projects are designed to provide accessible, hands-free alternatives to traditional input devices, making them ideal for users with limited mobility or anyone looking for an innovative way to control their computer.
