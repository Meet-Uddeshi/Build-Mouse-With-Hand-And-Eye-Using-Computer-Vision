# **Projects Overview**

# 1. **Eye-Controlled Mouse**
A hands-free mouse control system allows users to control the mouse pointer with eye movements and simulate clicks with eye blinks.

# 2. **Hand-Controlled Mouse**
A touchless mouse control system using hand gestures, allows users to control the mouse pointer and simulate clicks.

# **Features**

# **Eye-Controlled Mouse**
- **Eye Landmark Detection**: Tracks facial landmarks around the eyes.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Webcam video processed in real-time.
- **Pointer Control**: Move the cursor based on eye movements.
- **Blink Detection**: Simulate clicks with eye blinks.
- **Mirror Image Effect**: Flips webcam image for intuitive interaction.
- **Dynamic Tracking**: Display of tracked landmarks in real-time.
- **Simple Interface**: User-friendly for easy interaction.

# **Hand-Controlled Mouse**
- **Hand Landmark Detection**: Tracks hand positions and gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Detect hand gestures via webcam.
- **Thumb and Index Finger Tracking**: Measures the distance to simulate clicks.
- **Pointer Control**: Move the cursor based on hand gestures.
- **Mirror Image Effect**: Flips webcam image for better usability.
- **Dynamic Hand Tracking**: Real-time feedback of hand landmarks.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-understand interface for hand gesture control.

# **Purpose**
These projects aim to offer an accessible and innovative input method, particularly for individuals with physical impairments. They provide hands-free interaction with a computer, eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or touchpad.
